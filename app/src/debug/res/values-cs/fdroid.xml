Add to Zip for android-s share/send menu.

Easy collecting files from every supporting app into
one zip-file while being 'on the go' or offline.
(Note the english 'to go' means 'while traveling').

This collecting '2go.zip'-file is like a suitcase
where you can put things (files) into from nearly everywhere (from
every app that supports 'share' / 'send') and that
can travel  everywhere (via email,
bluetooth, nfc).

The program's author uses ToGoZip to collect new android calendar entries
that should be later imported into a desktop PC calender.

Required Android Permissions:

* WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to save/update '2go.zip' to some public folder.
