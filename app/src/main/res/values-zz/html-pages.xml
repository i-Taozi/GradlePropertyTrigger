 for android's <i>'share'/'send'</i> menu: <br/>
 <br/>
 Easy collection of files from every supporting app into
 one zip-file while beeing '<i>on the go</i>' or offline.<br/>
<br/>

 where you can put things (files) into from nearly everywhere (from
 every app that supports <i>'share'/'send'</i>) and that
 can travel&nbsp; everywhere (via email,
 bluetooth,&nbsp;nfc).<br/>

 In the beginning this program was developed to collect new android calendar
 entries (<a
