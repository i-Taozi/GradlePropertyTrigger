<b><i>"Add to Zip"</i></b>
 for android's <i>'share'/'send'</i> menu: <br/>
 <br/>
 Easy collection of files from every supporting app into
 one zip-file while being '<i>on the go</i>' or offline.<br/>
<br/>
This collecting <i>2go.zip</i>-file is like a suitcase
 where you can put things (files) into from nearly everywhere (from
 every app that supports <i>'share'/'send'</i>) and that
 can travel&nbsp; everywhere (via email,
 bluetooth,&nbsp;nfc).<br/>
<br/>
The program's author uses ToGoZip to collect new android calendar entries
 that should be later imported into the desktop-pcs-s calender.
