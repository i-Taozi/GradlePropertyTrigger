**Q: Why is a task manager named "Notes"?**

*A: The app started with only the note taking features. Syncing with
Google Tasks seemed like a good idea because everyone already has a
Google account. Then it only made sense to support the rest of the
features of Google Tasks. I'm not happy with the current state of things
and am thinking about ways to separate the two concepts (Notes/Tasks)*

**Q: Can you make a theme with yellow background and black lines?**

*A: Absolutely not. I designed the app to get away from things like that.
If you want skeuomorphic design, go buy an iPhone.*

**Q: Will you add colors/priority to notes?**

*A: Short answer: no. Long answer: I try hard to keep the app simple.
Adding more features like this would make it more complicated. There
are plenty of task managers out there that have more features than
my app. I don't use those features and hence I don't want them in
my app. Until I see a real use for them, they won't be implemented.*

**Q: I want to have a check list inside a note. Can you add this? Task program X has it**

*A: No. That would go against the entire structure of the app.
If you want a shopping list for example, create a list called "Shopping list".
Then you have a checklist for your shopping. Don't be afraid to create lists,
and then delete them when you're done with them. Use them with the widget
to put the check list straight on your lock screen for example.*

**Q: Will I ever be able to reorder my notes or set sub tasks?**

*A: One day perhaps. It's quite a messy thing to implement (in some part
due to stupid decisions made by me early in the project). I have put
a fair bit of time into it but have yet to come up with a satisfactory
solution. If this is a vital feature to you, you might have to look
elsewhere for now I'm afraid.*

**Q: Can you add a save button?**

*A: It's a useless button. Notes are saved when they are closed or
when the screen goes dark. Learn to trust it.*
