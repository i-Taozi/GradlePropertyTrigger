No matter what you do, **always** include the mod version you're currently using when reporting bugs ('latest' does not suffice) because otherwise I'll get really confused and your issue will end up being ignored for much longer than normally.

If your issue is on Minecraft 1.9.4 or higher, you should report it here instead: https://github.com/blay09/RefinedRelocation2/issues

The 1.7.10 version is pretty much dead by now, so unless the bug you want to report literally sets your PC on fire there's a good chance it won't be fixed.
