Improvements:

* [#4315] Allow the oil dimension and biome exclusion lists to be treated as whitelists instead.
  * Toggle either "worldgen.oil.excludedBiomesIsBlacklist" or "worldgen.oil.excludedDimensionsIsBlacklist" in order to change this.
* Fix a few performance issues with all ticking buildcraft tiles and a few more engine specific issues.
* Fix a few performance issues with the fluid pipes.
* Add an advancement to unlock the list recipe when you have 7 or more items in a single diamond pipe filter.
* Enabled several display config options by default: useBucketsStatic, useBucketsFlow, useLongLocalizedName, and changed timeGap to "seconds" rather than "ticks".

Bug fixes:

* [#4297] Fixed the quarry ignoring the maximum build height when it is placed too high up.
* [#4317] Fix a crash with little tiles because AlexIIL didn't implement a reflection getter correctly.
* Fix silicon having an accidental dependency on transport. Again.
* Fix fluid pipes not saving the current flow direction.
* Fix all API names having uppercase characters. The old scheme was "BuildCraftAPI|<module>", and the new scheme is "buildcraftapi_<module>".
* Theoretically fix the tank and pipe fluid renderer not always getting the fluid texture correctly.
