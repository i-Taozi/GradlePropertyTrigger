Improvements:

* Ported to minecraft 1.8.8!
* Core:
  * Blueprints and templates can be viewed with a right click!
    * Just never use a large blueprint! (Its very slow)
* Builders:
  * The Builder now shows if it holds a blueprint or template from the model!
* Transport:
  * Power pipes now show the flow of power
  * Gates are 3D
  * Gates now have a trigger and action selection gui
* Energy:
  * Engines now use both static block models and a TESR for rendering (Its a bit faster)

Changes:

* Transport:
  * All pipes use a different texture. Its a small difference but its mostly just new random noise added.
