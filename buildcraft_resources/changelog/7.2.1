Everything from 7.1.16, as well as:

Improvements:

* **Rendering**
  * Massive FPS boost via caching commonly used models and sub-models of pipes (AlexIIL)
  * Moved pipe wire rendering into the TESR, now it won't kill your FPS when wire state changes rapidly.
* Add the option to change detailed client-side configuration inside of resourcepacks- any option that contains a "|" (say "gui.filler|extra.modeFirst") can
     be changed via creating a resource pack with "assets/buildcraftconfig/gui/filler.properties" and adding a line "extra.modeFirst=<whatever>"
