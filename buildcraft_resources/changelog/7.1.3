BREAKING CHANGES!

* Cobblestone Structure Pipes have a new recipe. (asie)
* Electronic Libraries have a new recipe matching the looks better. (asie)
* Quartz Fluid Pipes no longer connect to Cobblestone or Stone Fluid Pipes. This might break existing builds! (asie)

NON-BREAKING CHANGES BUT STILL IMPORTANT!

* [#2886] Server blueprints are now saved inside [world]/buildcraft/blueprints as opposed to config/buildcraft/blueprints/server. The old directory will keep working, however.

Additions:

* Core:
  * New Lists! (asie)
    * Sort by type, material, or both! Precise sorting!
    * See with a tooltip if an item matches the List!
    * They can also sort armor, tools and fluids by type!
* Transport:
  * Power Adapters! Connect Kinesis Pipes to non-Kinesis pipes. (asie)

Improvements:

* Core/Any:
  * [#2345] Finish adding command localization (asie, warlordjones)
  * Minor optimizations (asie, gamerForEA)
  * Use integrated server data in singleplayer for certain tiles - back to the smoothness of 1.2.5! (asie)
* Builders:
  * Massive improvements to Builder logic and heuristics (asie)
  * Improved pipe rotation support (asie)
* Factory:
  * Chutes now support the Comparator (asie)
  * Flood Gates now have configurable sides. No idea when I fixed that, but it works now. (asie)
  * Less lag on Tank updating - new comparator update system (asie)
* Robotics:
  * Robots can now be destroyed via swords and projectiles (asie)
  * Requesters now support the Comparator (asie)
  * Add events for robot interaction and removal (asie)
* Transport:
  * Filtered Buffers now support the Comparator (asie)
  * Glass Facades no longer render the "plug" (asie)
  * Lenses do not require Iron Ingots anymore (asie)
  * New power beam display algorithm (asie)
  * Rewritten pipe wires - should now propagate more or less instantly. (asie)
  * Fluid pipe capacity and extraction rate now scales with the base flow multiplier. (asie)

Bugs fixed:

* [#3017] Crash if unable to extend stripes pipe (asie)
* [#3015] Packager pulls from input only slots from adjacent machines (asie)
* [#3010] Pipe wire does not activate when connecting by building through striped pipe (asie)
* [#2956] PipePluggable leaking state on the client (asie)
* [#2951] Obsidian Pipes not working right in certain circumstances (asie)
* [#2925] Rails on gravel not placing correctly (asie)
* A few robot bugs (hea3ven)
* Force/Forbid Robot statements not accepting lists (asie)
* "Lens-Filter" diodes not working (asie)
* Stirling engines heat up to green again (asie)

API changes (I will document the API eventually):

* Blueprints:
  * Schematics can now depend on relative blocks to be built before they are placed (things like torches, ladders, redstone wire, etc.) (asie)
* Lists:
  * New list matching API for custom sorting support! (asie)
* Robots:
  * Rewritten request system! You can now check what items BC machines need with a simple interface! (hea3ven)
* Transport (Internal):
  * PipeTransports can now have their own renderers via PipeTransportRenderer! (asie)
