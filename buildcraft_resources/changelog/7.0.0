Additions:
* **New textures!** - "Essence" made by (CyanideX)
* **Modularization** - BuildCraft is back to being modules (asie)
* Blocks:
  * Changed automatic crafting mechanics:
    * Redstone Engines speed up the Auto Workbench a little bit (asie)
    * The Auto Workbench now supports non-stackable items and has an internal buffer (asie)
  * Blueprint Library renamed to Electronic Library, supports copying books - and soon other things! (asie)
  * Rewritten Zone Planner map system - should have much less lag and take up less disk space!
    * **Note** - all existing zone planner previews will disappear. To reload them, simply break and place the zone planner!
  * You can now place a Marker-using machine next to any part of the box and not just corners (asie)
* Items:
  * Paintbrush for dyeing pipes and other supported blocks (asie)
  * Debugger for developer use (asie)
  * Map Locations can now be named (in the Zone Planner) (asie)
* Gates:
  * Gate recipes now show up in NEI properly (asie)
  * Light Sensor expansion for detecting brightness in front of a gate (asie)
  * Gate statement parameters now display the item stack information (asie)
* Pipes:
  * Massive optimizations - up to 3x less server-intensive (asie, Player)
  * Diamond pipes now sort in a round-robin manner, allowing for acting as Distribution Pipes (asie)
  * Improvements to Stripes Pipes:
    * Extending or retracting a Stripes Pipe now carries over all its gates, pipe wires and pluggables (asie)
    * You can now extend pipe wires by putting them into a Stripes Pipe (asie)
    * PlaceBlock now works directly in front of a block again (asie)
    * Stripes Pipes can now have their output direction controlled with Gates (asie)
    * Stripes Pipes can now place and break Minecarts (asie)
    * Stripes Pipes can now throw XP Bottles and shoot fireworks (asie)
  * Made items in pipes move at a much smoother rate (rendering) (asie)
* Robots:
  * Improved robot light handling - the light now denotes sleep state and battery charge level (asie)
  * New Robot triggers and actions: Linked, Reserved, In Station and Robot Mandatory (asie)
  * Robots can now use modded pickaxes, shovels and axes (asie)
  * Behaviour change: robots now always output to item/fluid pipes, not item/fluid containers (asie)
* Misc.:
  * Lasers now glow in the night (asie)
  * Miscellanous optimizations (asie)
  * Packets are now sent in a separate thread, causing most of the pipe optimizations and many other things (asie, Player)

Bugfixes:
* [#2372] Filters not working with Clay Pipes (asie)
* **Stopped wooden item pipes from exploding** (asie)
* Structure pipes not respecting blocking pluggables (asie)
* Fixed alternate slimeball-based pipe sealant recipe being uncraftable (asie)
* Fixed minor Zone Planner rendering issues (asie)

APIs:
* IDebuggable, for debugger compatibility in tile entities (asie)
* LibraryAPI for supporting copying of custom items in the Electronic Library (asie)
* ISided/IRedstoneStatementContainer (asie)

Breaking changes:
* Item pipes may no longer be connected to the front of the Mining Well or Quarry.
* Behaviour change: robots now always output to item/fluid pipes, not item/fluid containers
* Lists are no longer recursive
