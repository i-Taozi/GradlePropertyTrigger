Additions:
	Recipes for two new blocks: the Requester (used by robots to take requests for specific items) and Zone Planner (a highly advanced block used to mark large areas of land for robos to work on).

	[#2124] Added debug options to print out the list of all registered schematics and facades. (asie)
	[#2107] Gate/pipe/tile API changes - refer to the PSA! (asie)
	Autodetection of simple blocks and fluids for schematics (asie)
	Further improved miner robot ore detection (asie)
	Gate Expansion IMC to let modders add custom gate expansion recipes (asie)
	Huge network optimizations in the builder and laser, as well as general improvements in the mod (asie)
	Improve redstone input handling (asie)
	Improved translations for German (Vexatos), Italian (TheVikingWarrior) and Chinese (crafteverywhere)
