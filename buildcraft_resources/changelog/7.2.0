NOTE: This changelog is likely incomplete. There have been a lot of little changes in the mod which may not have been caught properly.

Additions:

* **Ported to Minecraft 1.8.9.** This took a lot more effort than we ever expected.

Improvements:

* **Rendering**
  * Builder now shows if a blueprint or template is inserted (AlexIIL)
  * Clear lenses now use a water texture (AlexIIL)
  * Engines are now a static/dynamic mix, meaning they are less FPS-taxing (AlexIIL)

  * Power in pipes is now animated, showing its direction (AlexIIL)
  * Slight tweaks to many textures across the mod (asie, AlexIIL)
  * Things now have somewhat more 3D models (gates, docking stations, builders, fillers at least) (AlexIIL)
  * The Builder has an icon showing if a gate has turned it off. (AlexIIL)
  * The Filler has an icon showing if a gate is locking the pattern, or if it is in a different mode to normal. (AlexIIL)
  * The entire frame for the quarry is now transparent, matching the texture of the frame block (AlexIIL)
  * The quarry frame lights properly depending on the light value of the block each part is in (AlexIIL)
