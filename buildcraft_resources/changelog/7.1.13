I recommend that you double-check your gate setups after this update.

Note for Regrowth/IguanaTweaks users: If you have disabled vanilla tools working in your pack, they won't work anymore with BuildCraft robots since ~7.1.10. They used to, but they won't, as now robots emulate a real player far more accurately.
