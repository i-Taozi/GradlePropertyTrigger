Additions:
* Lenses! Crafted from an iron ingot, a dye and a piece of glass in an Assembly Table, they are used to color items passing through them on pipes. (asie)
  * Yes, you can stick them on the sides of pipes. Fancy!
* Filters! Replace an iron ingot with a bar in the lens recipe to filter items passing through by color.
* Facade rework: hollow facades are now explicit, separate items, craftable in the Assembly Table. (You can also turn existing regular facades to hollow facades and back.) (asie)
* More machines can now be controlled with gate actions (asie)
* Lapis and Daizuli pipes can have their colour set with a dye (asie)
* Multiple pulses with Autarchic Pulsars are now back (asie)
* Quartz Gates! Inbetween Iron and Emerald gates, they contain 2 trigger/action sets with 1 parameter for each! (asie)
* Fuel energy production rate config option (marcin212)
* Gate and chipset recipe cost multiplier options for modpack developers (asie)
* Gates and wires now glow in the dark when active (ganymedes01)
* Pipe wires have a slightly improved texture (CyanideX)
* GUI improvements:
  * You can now use the scrollwheel in Gates (to scroll through triggers and actions) and Zone Planners (to zoom in and out) (asie)
  * F5 now refreshes the zone planner map (asie)
* Chutes can now be powered with Engines, much like wooden pipes, to extract items; however, they have a 10 RF/t cap (asie)

Improvements:
* Adjusted quarry speed to return pre-RF speeds (asie)
* Massive rendering improvements (especially in terms of shading) (ganymedes01)
* Reduced pipe item network packet size (asie)
* Optimized TileEntity lookups (asie - with thanks to skyboy)
* Optimized blueprint loading from NBT (asie)

Removed:
* The pipe item/fluid exclusion lists - they were broken for quite a few versions now anyway (asie)

Bugfixes:
* [#2353] Liquid dupe bug with BlockTank (asie - with help from mezz)
* [#2348] NPE when removing a docking station of an unloaded robot (hea3ven)
* {#2344] NPE on opening GUI (asie)
* [#2340] Quarry did not drop items from inventories (asie)
* [#2331] Filler world corruption (asie)
* [#2247] BuildCraft entities do not render more than 40 blocks away (ganymedes01)
* [#2201] SMP Robots break to item or disapear when a chunk is unloaded (hea3ven)
* Facades of coloured blocks using item colour instead of block colour (ganymedes01)
* Fixes in robot pathfinding algorithm (hea3ven)
* Fluid pipes now connect to tankless FluidHandlers, fixes HQM Liquid QDS (asie)
* Hollow facades have broken textures on one side (ganymedes01)
* Miner robot's harvest level being reset on world close/unload. (hea3ven)
* NPE in ColorUtils (asie)
* NPE in ResourceId (asie)
* Rare NPE in Assembly Tables (asie)
* Wooden pipes used 10 RF too many in rare edge cases (asie)
* Wooden power pipes could not have gates for checking energy in nearby machines (asie)

For modders:
* New API: IRedstoneEngineReceiver - does what the name says it does.
* Massive buildcraft.api.transport/buildcraft.api.pipes rework.
* Unused functions removed from buildcraft.api.core.
* PipePluggable API refined enough to let people define custom PipePluggables.
