Changes:

* Added a lot of config options for how the quarry operates:
    * "quarryMaxTasksPerTick": The maximum number of tasks for the quarry to attempt per tick (where a task is either moving the frame, or mining a block).
    * "quarryTaskPowerDivisor": 1 divided by this value is added to the power cost for each additional task done per tick.
    * "quarryMaxFrameMoveSpeed": The maximum number of blocks that a quarry frame arm is allowed to move, per second. (0 is infinite)
    * "quarryMaxBlockMineRate": The maximum number of blocks that the quarry is allowed to mine each second. (0 is infinite)
* Improved the performance of the pump a bit.
* Improved the performance of the quarry event listener a lot.
* Randomised the iteration order of quarries
    * This allows multiple stacked quarries to mine out different blocks at once, which looks a lot better than before.

Bug Fixes:

* Add more information to the crash report to help issues like [#4513].
* Only register oil biomes if they are enabled in the config, rather than always.
* Fixed stirling engines "pausing time" when they reached overheat.
    * So now if something started to burn it will always continue burning out.
    * However the next item won't be started.
* [#4526] Fix MessageUtil sharing a delayed queue with the server + the client.
* [#4527] Fix the 2d filler patterns not rotating correctly.
* [#4529] Fix some BC blocks with an inventory dropping more items then they should.
* [#4530] Fix a crash when an item has an empty tooltip.
