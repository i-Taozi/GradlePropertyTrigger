Whenever you're working on the (SQLite) persistence layer of your #Android app, especially when debugging a problem, it can be invaluable to see the executed SQL statements in plain text in logcat.

So for verbose logging simply set the appropriate properties with "adb shell" like this:

adb shell setprop log.tag.SQLiteLog V
adb shell setprop log.tag.SQLiteStatements V
adb shell stop
adb shell start

That's it. Whenever any of the installed apps now accesses the database you should see the executed statement in the log output.
