# Least-Squares Lack of User Specified Weighting Vector

- Useful for robustified optimization

# Dogleg Methods

If the matrix is not positive definite then it converges very slowly. Potential solutions involve:
- LDL with D being augmented to ensure it can be solved
- Look into Ceres solver and see how it handles this situation
  * Code comments mention solving a dampened system with a regular solver
  * This is a bit like a hybrid of LM and TR

# L-BFGS
