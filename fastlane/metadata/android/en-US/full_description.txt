<p>Add to Zip for android-s share/send menu.</p>
<p>Easy collecting files from every supporting app into
one zip-file while being 'on the go' or offline.
(Note the english 'to go' means 'while traveling').</p>
<p>This collecting '2go.zip'-file is like a suitcase
where you can put things (files) into from nearly everywhere (from
every app that supports 'share' / 'send') and that
can travel  everywhere (via email,
bluetooth, nfc).</p>
<p>The program's author uses ToGoZip to collect new android calendar entries
that should be later imported into the desktop-pcs-s calender.</p>
<p>Required Android Permissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to save/update '2go.zip' to some public folder.</li>
<li>READ_LOGS: after app crash the errorlog is written to {last-zip-dir}/toGoZip.logcat-*.txt or clipboard</li>
</ul>
